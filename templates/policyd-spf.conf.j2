# I only want to add the SPF check headers to my E-Mails and I do not want to reject any messages for SPF failures.
# To achieve this I had to change following two lines of my default configuration:

HELO_reject = False
Mail_From_reject = False

# I personally choose not to reject any mail based on the SPF results, because I have a tiny user base and receive
# only relatively few phishing mails. If you receive lots of phishing and your users are likely to click all the nice
# links they get, you should consider rejecting mail that fails SPF checks. But this might lead to missing a few E-Mails
# if a legit sender did not configure his SPF properly.
